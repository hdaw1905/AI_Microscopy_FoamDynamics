# Image-Driven Foam Stability Analysis from Microscopy

This repository contains the code and analysis for the Microscopy Hackathon 2025
(AISCIA Informatics use case).

## Overview
We present a fully image-driven workflow that links microscopic bubble dynamics
observed in time-resolved microscopy images to macroscopic foam stability.
All features are extracted directly from segmented images and analyzed using
interpretable machine learning.

## Contents
- Full-resolution microscopy image processing
- Bubble geometry and spatial feature extraction
- Temporal dynamics (coarsening, entropy, packing)
- Image-derived foam stability proxies
- Explainable machine learning analysis
- Visual dashboards and GIFs

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Allow Google Drive access when prompted
3. Run all cells (Runtime → Run all)
