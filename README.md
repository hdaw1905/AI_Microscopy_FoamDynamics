# Image-Driven Analysis of Bubble Dynamics and Foam Stability

**Microscopy Hackathon 2025 – AISCIA Informatics**

This repository contains the final submission notebook for an image-driven,
explainable machine learning analysis of bubble dynamics and foam stability
using time-resolved microscopy images.

## 📌 How to Run (Judges)

1. Download the dataset from:
   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O1y_lesCDsoj3T3hb9_en9Q1v9cR2eQ-?usp=sharing

2. Unzip the dataset and upload the folder  
   `AI_Microscopy_FoamDynamics`  
   to your Google Drive **My Drive**.

3. Open the notebook in Google Colab:
   `notebooks/AI_Microscopy_FoamDynamics.ipynb`

4. Run the notebook **from top to bottom**.

No code modification is required.
